Calculate the average width of one staple.average width of one staple in mm[2]\n(b) A student wants to find the volume of one strip of 40 staples. The student has a measuring cylinder and a beaker of water as shown in Fig. 1.2.\nDescribe how the student can determine the volume of one strip of staples by using the equipment shown in Fig. 1.2.[4]\n(c) The staples are made from a block of metal. The mass of the block is 296g. The volume of the block is 33.2cm3.Calculate the density of the metal. Include the unit.[4]"

She plots a graph of the results.Fig. 2.1 shows the graph of her results.\n(i) Use the graph to determine the length of the spring when the student adds a load of 8.0N to the spring.[1]\n(ii) Use the graph to determine the load added to the spring when the extension of the spring is 7.0cm. [2] \nA load stretching a spring is an example of a force changing the size of an object.[1] \n(c) A clamp stand used in the experiment has a weight of 8.6N. Calculate the mass of the clamp stand.[3]"
