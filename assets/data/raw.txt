6 (a) Fig. 6.1 shows a converging lens and its principal axis. The points F1 and F2 are each a 
principal focus of the lens.
 
An object O is placed between F¹ and the lens.
(i) On Fig. 6.1, draw two rays from the top of the object O to locate the image.
Label the image I. [3]
(ii) The object O is moved to the left along the principal axis so that it is further from the lens  than F¹. 
Fig. 6.2 is a diagram of the new arrangement with the new image shown.  
Underline three of the terms below that describe the image shown in Fig. 6.2.
diminished; enlarged; inverted; real; same size; upright;virtual [2]
(b) Fig. 6.3 shows yellow light passing through a glass prism.
Blue light enters the prism along the same path as the yellow light. 
On Fig. 6.3, draw the path of the blue light as it enters, passes through and leaves the prism
 
Blue light enters the prism along the same path as the yellow light.
On Fig. 6.3, draw the path of the blue light as it enters, passes through and leaves the prism.[2]

7(a) State a typical value for the speed of sound in air.[1]
(b) A sound wave in air has a wavelength of 22 mm.
Using your value for the speed of sound in (a), calculate the frequency of the sound wave.[2]
(c) Fig. 7.1 shows a solid block made from hot liquid metal. As the liquid cooled, a bubble formed inside the block. The bubble is not visible from outside the block.
  
Describe and explain how to use ultrasound to determine the size and position of the bubble 
inside the metal block. You may draw on the diagram.[4]
